# Dataset description
   The folder specdata contains one file per monitor.
# Monitor : is a device that captures the sulphate and nitrate values and stores it by date. 
#           The monitors are presumably at different locations
# Key points:           
#   a. NA means values are not available.
#   b. A complete case is a row in each file where there's no NA. Meaning good quality data.

# Programming assignment 1, part 3
# Pre-requisites:
#   a. Atleast a basic understanding of corelation. 
#   b. reading CSV into data frame, selecing rows/columns, modifying data, concatinating 
# Objective:Find the coorelation between sulphate and nitrate levels with a condition that
#           each file must have atleast a minimum number of complete cases. And this number     
#           is ditermined by threshold. Meaning, calculate coorelation with files that meet a minimum 
#           the 'threshold' of data quality'. So if the Threshold is  say 150, one should have 
#           atleast 150 complete (rows with no NA) per file.
#                     
# Approach:
#   a.  Create a grouped data set (in a ddataframe) list number of obeservations (nobs) by file (id). This is          
#       Complete.R - part 2 of the programming assignment
#   b.  Now that we know number of complete cases per file, create a data set that 
#       meets the threshold condition. In our example of threshold of 150, in this 
#       new dataset, keep only the ones that have nobs > 150. This data set now lists
#       files, each of which has enough observations for calculating corelation of
#       sulphate and nitrate leves.
#   c.  For each file now (use a loop), calculate the corelation using the cor function in r
#       Spend some time understanding the use paramenter that tells the function on 
#       how NA values are treated when corelation is calculated. Remember, evven though
#       we did choose files that have 'enough number' of complete cases, we still have 
#       rows with incomplete cases. The use parameter will ditermine how these row will
#       be treated.
#   d.  As we loop through the id can calculate corelation using cor function, 
#       we get a number (returned by cor function) that needs to be stored in a 
#       numeric vector (use c to concatinate).
#   e.  At the end, we have iterated through the list and calculated the corelation for
#       each ID (file or monitor)
# Note on example output:
#    a. head - shows the first some values of the numeric vector that list corelation
#       for each file
#    b. Summary : For our numeric vector that has corelation of sulfate and nitrate values
#                 for each monitor, summary fuction gives us the minimum value
#                 of corelation, quantiles, mean, and sd. To understand what this means
#                 one will have to have a basic understanding of these terms. You tube 
#                 is a great resource
